# TaffyKT â€” Kotlin Port of Taffy

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This project is currently a 'Work In Progress'

This library is a port of excellent Rust-written [Taffy][taffy_url] UI layout
library for Kotlin.

</div>

## Main Goals
- Provide feature parity with the original [Taffy][taffy_url] library
- Ensure identical behavior and pass all tests as the original [Taffy][taffy_url].
- Cannot guarantee it will have the same performance as the original [Taffy][taffy_url] even if it is a goal.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Please note that this is a dependency for another project I'm working on, and
I am not necessarily planning to maintain it actively. However, any PRs or issues are welcome.

Also I am once again taking this opportunity to thank the original authors of the [Taffy][taffy_url] library,
for their excellent work and for making it open-source.
