# Import Yoga Tests script

This is a rough and ready script for the purpose of syncing test fixtures from the [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/) which Taffy's predecessor Stretch was originally descended from, and whose tests are compatible with Taffy's generated test infrastructure.

## Usage

- Clone the [yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/) repo locally
- Set the `YOGA_FIXTURE_DIR` environment variable to the absolute path of `gentest/fixtures` directory within your local copy of the repo
- Run `cargo run` in this directory (or `cargo import-yoga-tests` in the root directory of the Taffy repo)
- Manually inspect the imported tests (if any - there may not be any new tests since the last sync) to check that they make sense for Taffy (and that they're not for example testing features we don't implement)
- Run `cargo gentest` in the root directory of the Taffy repo to generate actual tests from the fixtures
- Run `cargo test` to ensure that the new tests pass
- If any tests do not pass, either fix them or prefix the fixture file with an `x` to disable it (e.g. `align_content_stretch.html` would become `xalign_content_stretch.html`) and rerun `cargo gentest` to automatically remove the generated tests for that fixture.
